## An Irksome Morning

Today is yet another working day but I am excited to work in the office as I am a semi-workaholic that has a lot to take care of today.

I went to the nearest bus station from my dwelling place as usual to commute to my office. I was waiting patiently in the bus stop along with other overbearing peasants.

I waited for a staggering 9 minutes and the bus was nowhere to be seen and it really gets on my nerves. I am starting to get irritated and hallucinating because of this.

## It Does Not End There

Finally, after a whole minute later, I finally saw the bus bellowing down the road. In the symphony of emotions, my heart soared with breathtaking ardor, its rhythm racing like a thousand celestial stallions unleashed upon a moonlit gallop as the bus drove nearer and nearer. I am sweating with excitement, and my sickening body healed at an instant.

The moment when the bus stopped in front of me, I was flabbergasted and stunned. I couldn't feel my breath anymore and starts to comtemplate about my mixed feelings towards the arrival of the bus.

After regaining my conciousness, I realised that the bus and the fellow peasants has long been gone. "Can like that one meh," I chided.
